  </div>
  <p>Today, plastic is everywhere, from homes to oceans, from bottles and
    plastic bags to plastic cups and straws. This versatile material is
    in our appliances, computers, clothing, and so much more. Some of the
    most common places we find plastic are wrapped around the things we buy
    every day. After all, it’s an effective way to keep food and cosmetics
    clean and fresh. <br><br>But plastic is also lurking in some little known places.
    When you take a careful look around your home, the sheer number of things
    you’ll find containing plastic may surprise you.

  <h3>Best Alternatives to Plastic !!</h3>
  <p>
    Would you like to see less plastic in your home and less plastic waste
    in the world? <br>Here are some long-lasting plastic alternatives available
    right now.
  <ul>
    <li><span class = "makeBlue">Stainless steel</span></li>
    <br>
    <li>Tough and easy to clean, stainless steel options
      for reusable food and beverage storage have multiplied in recent years. You
      can replace single-use cups, kitchen storage, lunch boxes, and more with this
      durable metal.</li>
    <br>
    <li><span class = "makeBlue">Glass</span></li>
    <br>
    <li>While not biodegradable, glass is inert, inexpensive and
      infinitely recyclable. And, since many food items come packaged in glass, upcycling
      glass jars into food storage is a no-cost way to give your food packaging new life.
      Jars from jam, honey, pickles, nut butters, and so much more can be added to your
      no-waste toolkit for shopping from the bulk bins. They can also be repurposed to
      store leftovers and homemade drinks, or decorated and turned into homemade gifts. </li>
    <br>
    <li><span class = "makeBlue">Platinum silicone</span></li>
    <br>
    <li>Made primarily of sand, food grade platinum silicone is flexible
      and durable. It’s also heat tolerant, so you can boil, bake, and cook in these
      products without danger of denaturing. Look for silicone products without plastic
      fillers.</li>
    <br>
    <li><span class = "makeBlue">Beeswax-coated cloth </span></li>
    <br>
    <li>Used primarily as a replacement for plastic wrap and plastic bags, beeswax-coated fabric is easy to use and easy to clean. It also smells
      great. </li>
    <br>
    <li><span class = "makeBlue">Natural fiber cloth </span></li>
    <br>
    <li>Natural cloth can replace plastic bags. Sustainable clothing made from organic cotton, wool, hemp, or bamboo won’t shed plastic fibers when washed.
      Felted or recycled wool is a versatile, safe, and compostable material for children’s
      toys, household containers, and more.</li>
    <br>
    <li><span class = "makeBlue">Wood</span></li>
    <br>
    <li>A renewable resource, wood from sustainably-managed forests can replace plastic in household items like cleaning brushes, kitchen
      utensils, and cutting boards. </li>
    <br>
    <li><span class = "makeBlue">Bamboo </span></li>
    <br>
    <li>This fast-growing renewable resource can replace plastic in items like tableware and drinking straws. It is lightweight, durable, and
      compostable. </li>
    <br>
    <li><span class = "makeBlue">Pottery and Other Ceramics </span></li>
    <br>
    <li>Around for millennia, pottery and other fired ceramics offer a stable, waterproof alternative that’s good for food storage and
      tableware. Look for non-toxic glazes. </li>
    <br>
    <li><span class = "makeBlue">Paper </span></li>
    <br>
    <li>In days gone by, many things were packaged in plain paper. And while better than plastic, paper can’t be recycled infinitely because
      every time it’s reused, the fibres get shorter, limiting its use. Luckily all paper except
      the glossy kind is safe to put in your home compost.</li>
    <br>
    <li><span class = "makeBlue">Cardboard</span></li>
    <br>
    <li>Cardboard is fully compostable at home as long as it’s not coated in, you guessed it, plastic. Many companies are now
      packaging their products in plain cardboard to cut down on waste. You can also use cardboard
      boxes to replace storage containers in your home. </li>
    <br>
    <p>Keep in mind that anything you buy has an environmental footprint. Though longer lasting than plastic, things made from glass, metal,
      and so on still take energy to make and transport. For these swaps to make sense, you need to
      use them over and over and over again. Buying well-made, durable products will help ensure you
      get the most use from whatever you choose.</p>

  <h1 class = "mainHeading">How Not To Waste Food</h1>
  <h5 class = "date">June 14, 2021</h5>
  <p>Food is something that provides nutrients, energy for activity, growth, and all body
    functions such as breathing, digesting food, keeping warm; materials for the growth
    and repair of the body, and keeping the immune system healthy.
    <br><br>
    Around the world, more than enough food is produced to feed the global population—but more than 690 million
    people still go hungry. After steadily declining for a decade, world hunger is on the
    rise, affecting 8.9 percent of people globally.
    <br><br>
    Let’s not become the reason for world destruction in let’s just start saving food.
    <span style = "color: rgb(23, 132, 233); font-weight: bold;">Thinking how? </span>
    <br><br>
    <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.letsmakecyprusgreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/featured-image-1.0.jpg?fit=960%2C400&ssl=1" class = "image" />
    <br>
    Follow the following steps to contribute your bit towards food safety:
    <br><br>
  <ol>
    <li><span class = "makeBlue">Shop Smart :</span>
      <br><br>
      Most people tend to buy more food than they need. To avoid buying more
      food than you need, make frequent trips to the grocery store every few days rather than
      doing a bulk shopping trip once a week and stick to that list.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><span class = "makeBlue">Store Food Correctly :</span>
      <br><br>
      Improper storage leads to a massive amount of food waste. Foods
      that produce ethylene gas while ripening include Bananas, Avocados, Tomatoes, Cantaloupes,
      Peaches, Pears, and Green onions. Keep these foods away from ethylene-sensitive produce
      like potatoes, apples, leafy greens, berries, and peppers to avoid premature spoilage.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><span class = "makeBlue">Save Leftovers :</span>
      <br><br>
      Although many people save excess food from large meals, it is often
      forgotten in the fridge, then tossed when it goes bad. Storing leftovers in a clear glass
      container, rather than in an opaque container, helps ensure you don’t forget the food.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><span class = "makeBlue">Eat the Skin :</span>
      <br><br>
      People often remove the skins of fruits, veggies, and chicken when
      preparing meals. This is a shame because so many nutrients are located in the outer
      layer of produce and in poultry skin. For example, apple skins contain a large amount
      of fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><span class = "makeBlue">Understand Expiration Dates :</span>
      <br><br>
      <span class ="makeBold">“</span>sell by<span class ="makeBold">”</span> and <span class="makeBold">“</span>expires on<span class ="makeBold">”</span> are just two of the many confusing terms companies use on
      food labels to let consumers know when a product will most likely go bad. Do keep a
      check on it. BEFORE it expires eat the things out.
      <br><br><br>
      Be thankful till you have food, never waste it. Give it away instead of wasting it.
      Today's wastage can turn out to be worse for your kids. Think wise, act wisely, and
      save food.

    <li>The concept of needs, comprising of the conditions for maintaining an acceptable life
      standard for all people, and</li>
    <br>
    <li>The concept of limits of the capacity of the environment
      to fulfil the needs of the present and the future, determined by the state of technology
      and social organization. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>There are many ways to designing but why sustainability ?? </h3>
  <p>It focuses on meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future
    generations to meet their needs.</p>

  <h3>Why sustainability?</h3>
  <p>To maintain environmental quantity, growth, as well as healthcare and its pillars, are the: economy, society, environment.
    It can be directly proportional to the architecture, and in this, the most important goal
    is to make a building energy efficient for its lifetime by using design strategies that
    remove the negative environmental impact from a built environment.
    <br><br>
    Sustainable construction is defined as <span class = "makeBold">“the creation and responsible management of a healthy built environment,
                based on resource-efficient and ecological principles”.</span>
    <br><br>
    Urban gardens, green roofs, courtyards not only help in preserving the environment but scientifically proven to reduce depression
    also. Some fundamentals which are essential for cooling cities, producing oxygen, and filtering
    air pollution are parks, wetlands, lakes, forests, or other ecosystems, also providing safer
    routes for foot and bicycle communicators, a safe and healthy place for physical activities and
    recreation.
