## Short description

### What's the problem?

The problem that we are trying to give a solution for comes under zero hunger. The main objective behind our idea is to minimize food wastage that can eventually help needy to overcome their hunger with less or no price food. Wasting food is a common problem in our society. Food waste management is crucial since it can improve our environmental and economic sustainability.

### How can technology help?

Luckily, food waste is most definitely a solvable problem if consumers, businesses, farmers, and governments come together for a sustained effort. One big part of the solution, however, is emerging technology. Itâ€™s a tall order,  and to achieve these goals we need to do everything we can, both as individuals and as a society, to try to optimize our consumption. Through the help of web development technology we have decided to build a website that will connect people with extra food and people who are in need of that food. 

### The idea

We have identified the use of mobile technology to reduce food waste management and built a website that allows people to share their extra food items with people in need. This app will enable users to register, login, view food items, and log out. Any user in need can see all the food images shared by different users and can see the details.
